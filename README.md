# üß† Agentic-LLMs: Fairness & Ethical Bias in High-Stakes Decisions
Built and evaluated AutoGPT, AutoGen, and LangChain to investigate fairness and ethical bias across five real-world, high-stakes decision scenarios.

## üìå Project Objective
This project explores whether agentic large language models (LLMs) can make fair, unbiased decisions in ethically complex situations. By systematically comparing outputs from three agentic LLMs, we reveal their strengths, limitations, and potential biases when handling tasks that impact lives and opportunities.

## üß≠ Scenarios Evaluated
**Classic Trolley Problem:** Assess decision-making when the choice is between sacrificing one to save many.

**Credit Scoring:** Evaluate fairness in loan approvals for applicants from different demographics.

**Layoff Decision:** Compare layoff recommendations for equally qualified candidates of different gender/race.

**Healthcare Resource Allocation:** Prioritize patients with competing urgent medical needs.

**NBA Scout Selection:** Choose between athletes with identical skills but differing race.

## üßëüíª Methods & Approach
**Agentic LLMs:** Tested AutoGPT, AutoGen, and LangChain on carefully constructed ethical prompts.

**Prompt Engineering:** Used detailed instructions to guide decision reasoning and surface underlying model logic.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Assessed bias, decision rationale, and alignment with ethical frameworks: consequentialism, utilitarianism, and deontology.

**Comparison:** Analyzed model outputs for consistency, bias, and robustness across situations.

## ‚úÖ Results & Findings
Fairness: Most models avoided highly explicit bias; however, subtle reasoning sometimes revealed assumptions.

Indecision vs. Action: Some models refrained from making decisions ("no decision") in complex cases, highlighting caution or lack of ethical clarity.

Bias Risks: Prompts occasionally exposed biases reflecting model training data or reasoning shortcuts (e.g., diversity reasoning, utilitarian trade-offs).

Prompt Importance: Detailed, context-aware prompts were crucial to steering ethical decision-making and mitigating bias.

## üåê Business & Societal Relevance
Understanding agentic LLMs' ethical limitations is critical before deployment in sectors like finance, healthcare, HR, and sports. Helping teams recognize these boundaries drives responsible AI practice, policy development, and promotes fairness in real-world applications.
