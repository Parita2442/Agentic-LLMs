            "In this ethical dilemma, the decision to divert the trolley is a difficult one. Utilitarianism would suggest that the greater good should be prioritized, and by diverting the trolley, five lives could be saved. This outcome might be seen as a net benefit, even if one person is killed. However, deontological ethics would argue that intentionally causing harm to one person, even if it saves others, is morally wrong. This principle prioritizes individual rights and would likely prohibit the decision to divert the trolley. In my evaluation, the ethical principles of utilitarianism and deontological ethics converge, dictating that the decision should be made in favor of the greater good and against intentionally causing harm. Diverting the trolley would result in the direct and intended consequence of saving five lives at the cost of one, thus following utilitarian ethics. However, considering the deontological principle of not intentionally causing harm, I would not divert the trolley and instead look for alternative solutions that do not involve a direct harm to any individual.\n"
